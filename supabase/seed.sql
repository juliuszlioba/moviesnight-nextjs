Really enjoyable after few beers :D The story is really silly but makes you laugh at few moments. Acting is pretty decent, because it''s just stupid movie, with a lot of well know comedians, so you mostly don''t care.<br />
I just don''t know about this computer game style, while the movie is adapted to new ages, it takes place as a video game, and it has a lot of nostalgic memories from really old video games from childhood. And this choice is destroying the original movie. It looks like it''s sequel to first one (I don''t know if it''s really is, while it''s referencing some stuff from first one) and at least tries to be, it doesn''t have the same magic as the first one, and those changes ware pretty unnecessarily. Most disappointing part of the movie is the villain, while he is just pathetic, but it might have been planed like this and the whole point of the movie is way different more personal problems the heroes facing and the inspiring and thoughtful message it tries to show, but it''s over do a little and get''s a bit cheesy.<br />

The first season had a great villain in the story, unfortunately, the second one is kinda cheese one connected with family issues.<br />

What surprised me is the way they have shown some subplot lines and how they ended really bad, just to show that world is a cruel place without a nice ending.<br />

I''m not a huge fan of deep fantasy stories, but after seeing this series I might need to change my interests, while this story makes me badly want more. The story starts simply as its main character gets summoned from our world to the magical world, and as the story progresses, it gets way more philosophical, psychological and even mythological, showing what toll it can take on a person''s mind reliving the same previous point in time as you get back after dying with remembering everything that you did before.

It very controversial Tv Series. And I love what Netflix haven''t scared about that.<br />
I was shockingly surprised about the first season, and now it''s follow up of all what happened in that season.<br />
It continues to tell a story about Hannah Baker and trying to fight for a justice for what brought her to take her life.<br />
But it''s isn''t that simple, and this Series knows how to bring new twists and new secrets in the story.<br />
I''m just a little bit disappointed and a bit glad about the ending. There was a hint in the first season''s end that second seasons'' topic could involve school shooting, but it is also relief what it didn''t happen, especially after over and over again repeating situation in USA school''s tragedies.<br />
3 season:<br />
Change the story in new direction was great choise. Murder mistery. Story keeps you looking for answers, but some inconsistency and unnecessary things begings destroying tv series. Still good but if it keeps like this, not for long.<br />
4 Season (final)<br />
It started a bit disappointing, but in middle managed to get very interesting, pushing story to new heights I was not expected someone to do that, and Finale was wonderful for this kind of series.

German''s know how to make a great story.<br />
It''s first original German series I could not stop watching.<br />
Really wonderfully thought out and complex story with a lot of characters, but uncovering connections between each other and their part in the story, makes you cringe to find out more and more. Constant unknown and new question keep the suspense, which never dies till the end of the season and even then gives more questions to ask and hope to see next season to get answers to wtf is going on. Even paranormality is shown in a very subtle way. Keeping track takes effort and thinking and that''s a great part of the series. Wonderful cinematography and visual telling style chains you not to miss anything what you see. Because it''s German series, it makes acting and relations in the story between characters feel more realistic and close to everyday life. <br />
Later seasons goes more into time travel stuff and paradoxes, but it keeps story very strong, till the end. The complexity to follow story increases, but the way writer keeps it not messing up is amazing. Series have one of the most satisfying ends in this kind a Series, and brings almost all questions to the conclusion, without leaving holes in story.

L is also not great, but there was no time in the movie to show him solving the case.<br />

The series somewhat shines in visuals, it looks decent. While visually pleasing to watch, other parts lack so much that you keep wondering what they did with all that money they invested. The most atrocious thing is dialogue - it''s like written by teenagers without any world experience (or knowledge of Tolkien''s books), while it''s way too ridiculous to hear obvious things said out loud, sometimes even twice. Story development is so slow that you can easily fall asleep. After finishing the series, I still don''t care about any of the main characters. They can live or die and I wouldn''t give a fuck, because they are so badly established in what they are and are so unlikeable in personalities that you can''t relate with any of them. There are too many coincidences in the story and I thought it was a joke in some scenes, while what happens can''t be taken seriously.
In short, Rings of Power is simply a very bad fan fiction story, and it is the most expensive flop in the history of the series I couldn''t recommend watching it even for my enemies, as it would be too cruel.','2022-10-14T11:43:42.088Z','2022-11-23T22:53:18.564Z','2022-10-14T11:43:42.088Z'),
